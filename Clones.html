            They cloned  Jango fett an very good bounty hunter but was later killed which meant the clones later developed problems and was missing more shots than ususal. This really had a play in the clones.Clones were very important during the war. These type of people would fight the battles along side Jedis for the Republic. During the first episode it shows that clone troopers know what there roles are and that it is to die for the Republic. Clones were trained from birth to fight and if they dont pass the exams they become cleaning clones. Clones have one mission. To fight for the Republic in any way shape or form. Clones are very important.

            Captain Rex was an amazing clone. Fought in many battles under the command of General Skywalker. He was a great clone and thought more about his teammate than his mission. He was a great clone leader and was very precise and inspite of his reckless behavior he has won many battles. He was an infantry so he fought on the ground leading his soldiers into battle. His armor is unique to him and him only.

            Commander Cody was a clone commander known for following the rules. He would never bend the rules for even one clone. He was a strict but that got him his victories. His Jedi general was general Obi-wan Kenobi. This is probably how he go so strict because both of them follow the rules and never onced beneded for no man which is shown in the first season or first movie when they have a mole in the organization.

        <p>Clones in the clone wars were very memorable. They helped the jedi win and train other places to defend themselves from the separtist. With there many battles won people still hated them because they are manufactured. These were living creatures that lived to fight and nothing more. RESPECT </p>
