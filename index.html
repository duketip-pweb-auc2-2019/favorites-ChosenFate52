               <p>Background knowledge: The clone wars is a war between the Republic and the Separatist lead by Count Dooku. Dooku used to be a jedi but went to the dark side. The Separatist use droids to command their army while the Republic used manufactured clones from the planet kaminoo. This caused debate but the war happened for fight over the galaxy. Both sides had allies but the Republic had Jedi. Jedi are force users with lightsabers made of kyper krystal. Some people wanted the jedi not to be in the war but some did. This caused trouble as they knew jedi were going to be generals. Some jedis left the order and some stayed to fight and became the first generals. The war lasted 3 years with many bloodshed and tears. </p>
                <p>Star wars the clone wars is a show that happened inbetween episode 2 and episode 3(Attack of clones and Revenge of the sith.</p> 
                <p>This series has filled in on the characters thoughts and moves during the war more than the movie can explain. It shows the temptation the characters. It shows death, mourning, but victory and accomplishment. It states their moral. Would the soldier choose to complete the mission or save their fellow comrade. It depends on the clone.You could never ever get that deep understanding from the movies that is why this is my favourite show</p>
