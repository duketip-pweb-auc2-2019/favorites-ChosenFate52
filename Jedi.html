        <p id="Ani">Anakin(Left) and Obi wan kenobi(Right) were 2 jedi generals. They both have had many victory in the clone wars and played a big role in the clone wars. They both have a greater role in the movies also.
        </p> 
        <p id="anakin">Anakin's last name is Skywalker. He was a slave until Qui-Gon Jinn sent him free. He then became a jedi and was extraordinary. He was a great asset but had a wife which jedi were forbidden to have love because that
            would affect their judgement and it did many times. In his late life he became Darth Vader. Darth Sidious right hand man. Because of his injuries from Obi-wan he was forced to wear a suit which limited his abilities but he was still strong as ever. Overall he was a great Jedi
            in the clone wars.
         </p>
         <p id="Obi-wan">Obi wan Kenobi was a general which was a real Republic supporter. He did everything according to the jedi Order. Obi-wan took anakin as a aprentice when his master was killed in the first movie. He even almot took out Anakin his own students because he became a sith. He left him to die and he survived.
             Obi wan wasnt very extraordinary but was an amazing Jedi and trained two skywalkers in his liftime. He was sent at the Jedi Council and was a Jedi Master. He was a general to be feared and if you killed him you would get praised from Dooku as you killed his old foe. He was very OP.

         <p id="yoda">Yoda was a very skilled Jedi. He is a green creature which his species is known for being in the Jedi Order. He is the best Jedi in their timeline. He was the best Jedi Master and the only jedi master on the council besides Obi wan to survive order 66. If you watch the clone wars with 3 clones and himself he defeats an army of droids with full power and some of them have crazy abilities.
             He is the oldest jedi alive during the time also. He has so much wisdom that when most jedis have problems he is the one to talk to. He has trained many people like Count Dooku and etc. Yoda wasn't very active but when he fought he won. He trained Luke Skywalker later in the movies. Yoda in my opinion is the best Jedi. If Yoda was younger he would need to be nerfed mega hard.

        <p id="Mace">
            Mace Windu is a Jedi Master on the Jedi Council. He is a very important person in the clone wars . He had many victories during this war. He is very strategic and rarely trust anyone. He has devoted his life to jedis and is one of the loyal jedi. He is very strong and almost takes down darth sidious if Skywalker wasnt in the way and interfered. He is a very balanced character with morals for the jedi council and nothing else

        <p id="ahsoka"> 
            Ahsoka Tano is Anakin skywalker's pupil. In the first clone war movie it shows that Ahsoka Tano was given to Anakin on purpose so he ecan teach her. At first they didn't like eachother but then they gre a teacher-student bond. She has many victories in the clone wars and is very energetic. She is very flexible and small which makes her useful for many situations. She doesn't take no for an answer. Ahsoka was blamed near the end has to flee but her name get cleared. She then realized how quickly then turn so she leaves the jedi order. This is the last time she appears in the clone wars
